\section*{\center Abstract}

\section{Kinect \& NiTE Software Evaluation}
\noindent
To determine a method of evaluating the dance student, the limitations of the camera and the NiTE software must first be evaluated with respect to the criteria addressed below. To do this we use the UserViewer Application that comes as a sample with the NiTE software library with the camera elevated 75cm above the ground, within the 60cm to 180cm range that is suggested by Microsoft for optimal tracking. 

\subsection{Camera Range}
\noindent 
To test for the camera's range, we lay a tape measure on the ground starting from directly below the camera up to 8m away from the camera. We then use two subjects of different heights and body shapes to evaluate the performance of the camera and the software for tracking at different distances. The subject first starts within a few centimetres of the camera and slowly moves backwards until the camera calibrates and starts tracking and continues to do so until the tracking is lost. After this, the subject is required to start from the depths of the room, much further than the range of the camera, and to start walking slowly towards the camera, again taking a record of the following specifications. The results can be shown in Tables \ref{cam_range_180_away} to \ref{cam_range_150_toward}.

\noindent
These results highlight the fact that the camera has a restricted field of view and therefore the number of people that each camera can support is limited. This will have to be further considered when finalising a design for the application. One thing to note is that, since  the optimum distance away from the camera, with respect to tracking, is in the range of 1.5m to 3.5m it would not be beneficial to have the camera(s) in the corners of the room. This would cause a huge amount of the already small range to be wasted due to the height of the room.
